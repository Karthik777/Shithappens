Songroll Sky
============

A Meteor application/experiment. Listen to music, watch videos and chat with friends and people from all over the world in real-time. Powered by the Echo Nest, YouTube and Spotify APIs.

## Installing

To run Sky locally you will need to have Meteor installed. If you don't know what Meteor is about, please check [the official Meteor site](http://www.meteor.com).

- Clone this repository.
- Copy the ```api_keys.js.example``` file on the ```/lib``` folder as ```api_keys.js``` and add your own API keys there.
- That's it! You can now run ```meteor``` on the project's folder and you're done.

Please note that **you need keys for all services** on the ```api_keys.js``` file. Missing keys will result in the app not working properly.

## Getting my API keys

In case you don't know where to get keys for the services, here are some links with instructions:

- Twitter: [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com)
  * **On your app settings:**
  * Make sure to define a callback URL (if you're not sure, just use ```http://127.0.0.1:3000/_oauth/twitter?close```)
  * And make sure to check *"Allow this application to be used to Sign in with Twitter"*
